## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Console-based environment (for input and output)

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `sosmed.h`: Header file containing data structure definitions and function prototypes.
- `sosmed.cpp`: Implementation of the functions defined in `sosmed.h`.
- `main.cpp`: Main program for testing the implemented functionalities.

## Functionalities

### 1. Inserting and Deleting Users and Packages

Users and packages can be added to the system, and existing users and packages can be removed.

### 2. Establishing and Deleting Relationships

Users can subscribe to packages, and these relationships can be removed as well.

### 3. Counting Relationships

- **Counting relationships for each package:** Determine how many users are subscribed to each package.
- **Counting relationships for a specific user:** Find out how many packages a specific user is subscribed to.

### 4. Displaying User and Package Information

Display detailed information about users and packages, aiding in understanding the current state of the system.

### 5. Editing Relationships

Modify existing relationships between users and packages. This includes adding or removing users from packages.

For detailed information on each functionality, refer to the [code documentation](Sosmed-Management-Data-Structure/sosmed.h).
